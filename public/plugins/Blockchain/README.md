# Blockchain

TL;DR Add "native" blockchain (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc) functionality to Zeronet.

---

The Zeronet Core shares a limited subset of Bitcoin's cryptography features.

These are:
    - public/private keys
    - ECIES encryption

Zeronet uses almost NONE of Bitcoin's cryptocurrency features.

These are:
    - BTC wallet management
    - Message signing

## Planned Development

In addition to Bitcoin (BTC), this plugin will also offer native support for additional blockchains, including:
    - Ethereum (ETH)
    - Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
    - Monero (XMR)
